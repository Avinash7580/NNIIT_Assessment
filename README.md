# NNIIT_Assessment
Building the backend for a smart flashcard system. Users can add flashcards with just a question and answer — no subject is specified by them. Your backend will automatically determine the subject of the flashcard based on the text (e.g., presence of keywords like "photosynthesis" → "Biology").
